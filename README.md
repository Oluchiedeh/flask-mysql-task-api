# Building Your First Multi-Container Application with Docker: A Step-by-Step Guide

In modern application development, microservices and containerization have become crucial for creating modular, scalable, and maintainable applications. 
Multi-container applications are the backbone of modern web applications, allowing developers to separate different services into individual containers that work together seamlessly. 
In this blog post, we'll walk through creating a simple multi-container application with Docker using Flask (for the web server) and MySQL (for the database). 
This setup is perfect for learning how to build and connect different services within Docker, a skill essential for any DevOps engineer or developer.

# Prerequisites:
- Basic knowledge of Docker.
- Docker installed on your machine.
- Docker Compose installed on your machine.

# Step 1: Setting Up Your Flask Application
Let's start by creating a basic Flask application that connects to a MySQL database to store and retrieve data.

**File Structure: Create the following file structure for the project:**

multi-container

-app/
├── app/

│   ├── app.py

│   ├── requirements.txt

├── db/

│   └── init.sql

└── docker-compose.yml

**Writing the Flask Application.**
In the app/app.py file, write a simple Flask API that connects to a MySQL database:

**Flask Dependencies.**
In app/requirements.txt, add the required dependencies:


# Step 2: Initializing the MySQL Database.

To set up the initial database and table structure, we’ll use an SQL script in the db/init.sql file:

# Step 3: Configuring Docker Compose.

Docker Compose makes it easy to run multi-container applications. In this project, we’ll set up two services:

- `web` service for the Flask app
- `db` service for the MySQL database
In the root directory, create docker-compose.yml:

# Step 4: Creating a Dockerfile for Flask.

In the app folder, create a Dockerfile to define the Flask app container:

# Step 5: Building and Running the Application.
With all files in place, it's time to build and run the multi-container application.

1. Open a terminal, navigate to the project directory, and run:

`docker-compose up --build`

Docker Compose will build the `web` container and initialize the `db` container with the SQL file.

2. Once the containers are up and running, open a browser and visit `http://localhost:5000/` to see the home page of your Flask API.

# Step 6: Testing the Application.

To interact with the /tasks endpoint:

- Create a Task: Use `curl` or a tool like `Postman` to send a `POST` request:

`curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/tasks -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Task 1", "description": "A sample task."}'`

- Get All Tasks: Visit `http://localhost:5000/tasks` in your browser, or use curl to view all tasks.


# Conclusion.

You’ve built a simple, yet powerful, multi-container application using Docker! By separating the application into multiple containers, you’re now leveraging a core principle of modern app development: modular, scalable services. This example serves as a foundation for more complex, production-ready setups that can incorporate additional services like caching, load balancing, or microservices.

This project also highlights the strength of Docker Compose, allowing you to quickly and easily bring up complex systems. With this foundation, you’re well on your way to deploying robust applications in any environment.
